Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or the total value of all goods and services produced in the economy, increased at a 2.9% annualized rate during the period, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday. That reflected upward revisions to consumer and business spending, and compares with a previously reported 2.6% advance.",
